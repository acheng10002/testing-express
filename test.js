/* SuperAgent - low-level HTTP request helper library for Node.js and browsers
- lets me programmatically issue HTTP requests (.get(), .post(), .put(),

- .get(), .post(), .send() â†’ come from SuperAgent
- SuperAgent is a general-purpose HTTP client similar to Axios or fetch, but not
  specific to testing
SuperTest - high-level HTTP assertion helper library
- .expect(), .end(), .then() chaining to assert responses easily inside tests 
- SyperTest plugs into test runners like Jest
- SuperTest extends SuperAgent, specializing SuperAgent for testing HTTP servers
-- I can pass my Express app instance directly to request() instead of 
   needing a full server running on a port 
-- comes with assertion helpers, ex. .expect() for status, headers, body, etc. 
-- SuperTest has better test-runner integration, works with Jest and removes the
